Script Name: GTP help tool (GTPhelpTool) 
Author: Owen Goldthorpe 
Version: version1 (my first UI) 

Variables: current variable, I could think off is researching what commands I need to make sure it works, I also have considered the possibility it not working, so I plan break it down and go through it one step at a time so if anything, is not working I can come back to it when I understand the issue and know how to solve it 

 

Must do this thing: It must be able to move the objects into position and be able to color them. With the color being more secondary compared to moving the objects into place. 

Should do this thing: It should be able to recognize the different objects and have a set place and order to make the complete model

Could do this thing: what it could do, but Iâ€™m leaving for a later date is to have an animation of sorts. I would like to have an animation, but that can come later.
